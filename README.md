The [Common Data Model for Nonprofits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/nfp-accelerator#entities-and-workflows) is a sector-developed data schema interrelates program delivery, constituent and award management, fundraising, finance, and operations entities and attributes. The CDM serves as the foundation of all Microsoft nonprofit solutions, which drives data interoperability across disparate data and platforms. 

The [Nonprofit Accelerator] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/common-data-model/nfp-accelerator) extends the power of the Common Data Model for Nonprofits through sample data, sample applications, Power Platform applications, and guided walk-throughs to enable partners and nonprofits to extend constituent management, fundraising, award and fund management, and program delivery capabilities. 

[Program Design] (https://github.com/microsoft/Industry-Accelerator-Nonprofit/releases) is a Power Platform template application that partners can extend to help nonprofit program officers populate logframes (logical frameworks), design programs, select indicator sets like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and monitor and evaluate program outcomes. 

[International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI)] (https://iatistandard.org/en/news/microsoft-includes-iati-standard-non-profit-tools/) and Activity Standards are built into the Common Data Model for Nonprofits, allowing nonprofits to easily report on their development and humanitarian spending and projects [(learn more here)](https://github.com/microsoft/Industry-Accelerator-Nonprofit/releases/download/v2.2.3.1/NFP.Accelerator.2.2.-.IATI.User.Guide.docx). 

[Measurement] (https://github.com/microsoft/Industry-Accelerator-Nonprofit/releases/download/v2.2.3.1/NFP.Accelerator.2.2.-.IATI.User.Guide.docx) entities including items, relationships, and usage help nonprofits to measure the impact of their programs.   

[Volunteer Management] (http://Volunteer) is an optional add-on to the CDM that tracks volunteer preferences, skills and availability,  and establishes Volunteer Projects by leveraging Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation. 

The [17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)] (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) that define a global partnership to pursue peace and prosperity for people and the planet are built into the Program Design Power Application as an standard indicator set. This allows nonprofit program managers to design programs that align to and measure impact by the SDGs from Day 1 [(learn more here)] (https://github.com/microsoft/Industry-Accelerator-Nonprofit/releases/download/v2.2.3.1/NFP.Accelerator.2.2.-.Measurement.SDG.Icons.zip).
