This system was a build-with project from the Technology for Social Impact (TSI) Team at Microsoft Philanthropies co-developed with our partner Jump Start Ninja (http://jumpstartninja.com). 

This system has two major components: 
* A Bing API New search system with a PowerBI Dashboard: https://github.com/Microsoft/Nonprofits/tree/master/ProductsAndServices/ActivisimAndAwareness/SocialListening/KeywordSentimentAnalysis/Microsoft-NewsTemplate
* A Twitter monitoring system and accompanying dashboard: https://github.com/Microsoft/Nonprofits/tree/master/ProductsAndServices/ActivisimAndAwareness/SocialListening/KeywordSentimentAnalysis/Microsoft-TwitterTemplate

These systems have three features you can customize:
* The search terms/keywords to identify in the newsfeed or on twitter
* The ability to control the costs by enabling you to set limited for the search criteria (e.g., how often you perform an update)
* The ability to choose which languages to monitor

Features in progress include:
* The "Deploy to Azure" button will take away the steps required to configure the solution
* Demo Script introductory video
