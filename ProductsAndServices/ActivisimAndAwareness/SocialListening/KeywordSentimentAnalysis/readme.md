The Keyword sentiment analysis solution accelerator for nonprofits is a combination of prior art from AppSource.  With permission we have taken the work and modified it to be easier for the business user to modify the cognitive pipeline after installation.  
With the help of our partner Jump Start Ninja, we've added a UX that will enable the business user of a nonprofit to customize the pipeline in the following ways:
- The ability to change the keywords being monitored from the News and Twitter
- The ability to control costs by selecting the limits for the search
- The ability to control languages that are monitored
Coming Soon:
The "Deploy to Azure" button will take away the steps required to configure the solution.
