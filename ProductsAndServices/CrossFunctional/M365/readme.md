 [Modern Desktop Deployment and Management Lab Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/modern-desktop-deployment-and-management-lab)
 I personally recommend that every IT Pro that is or will be involved with Windows 10, Office 365 or EMS should have access to this lab kit as it has been one of my best resources for continual learning since joining Microsoft 2 years ago (with a few rebuilds thrown in). Be sure to review and practice the [Step-by-step labs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/modern-desktop-deployment-and-management-lab#step-by-step-labs). it is worth noting that we recently released Create a Configuration Manager technical preview lab in Azure guidance which I can see being really useful for provisioning an Azure hosted learning environment.

<H2/>  Certifications </H2>
 New Microsoft Role-based [Certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/browse-new-certification.aspx) Overview
 Most of the exams listed below are currently in beta, meaning there are few with directly aligned training courses available yet however this should change once these are fully released and the new Microsoft Learn content will help too.
 I recommend looking at the "skills measured" section of the exam you're interested in then try to gain hands-on experience with these areas and products using the [Modern Desktop Deployment and Management Lab Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/modern-desktop-deployment-and-management-lab) and the Office 365 / EMS E5 free trials.
 [Microsoft 365 Fundamentals - MS-900 ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-MS-900.aspx)– This is a great introduction to Microsoft 365 for those just starting their IT career or for those currently holding less technical hands-on positions such as management. 
Experienced IT Pros that have completed previous Microsoft client exams should skip this in my opinion.
